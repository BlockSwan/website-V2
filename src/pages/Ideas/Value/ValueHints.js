                Before proceeding, please read these helpful tips. Admission to

        <ListRule
          number="2"

        <ListRule
          number="3"
          text="Coins whose value is significantly determined by the movement of other prices should have an explanation of value that is independent of the asset."

        <ListRule
          number="4"
          text=" If an idea has been posted to the site, we are looking for unique insights and additional research. If an idea has been applied with quite frequently, it is probably a well-followed idea and it will be harder to give insights that we consider unique."
        />
        <ListRule
          number="5"
          text="If an idea isn't compelling, we recommend waiting to apply with an idea that is compelling."
        />
        <ListRule
          number="6"
          text="There is no guideline to length, but generally, the complexity of the write-up should match the complexity of the idea. Bitcoin just can't be written up in 2 pages."
